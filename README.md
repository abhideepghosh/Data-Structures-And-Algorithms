## Introduction

This repository is intended to be a learning resource for anyone interested in understanding and implementing data structures and algorithms. The content here covers a wide range of concepts and techniques that are fundamental to computer science and software development.

## Data Structures

1. Arrays

   - Arrays are fundamental data structures that store a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. They offer efficient access and manipulation operations.

2. Linked Lists

   - Linked lists are linear data structures composed of nodes that contain both data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. They provide dynamic memory allocation and constant-time insertion and deletion at both ends.

3. Stacks

   - Stacks are linear data structures that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. They are commonly used to manage function calls and store temporary data.

4. Queues

   - Queues are linear data structures that follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. They are used for tasks like managing tasks, scheduling processes, and more.

5. Trees

   - Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes that form a branching structure. Common types include binary trees, AVL trees, and more.

6. Graphs

   - Graphs are collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They represent complex relationships and are used in various applications like social networks, maps, and more.

7. Hash Tables
   - Hash tables (hash maps) store key-value pairs and use a hash function to map keys to specific indices in an array. They provide fast average-case access and retrieval.

## Algorithms

1. Searching Algorithms

   - Searching algorithms are used to find a specific element in a data structure. Examples include linear search and binary search.

2. Sorting Algorithms

   - Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a particular order. Examples include bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, and mergesort.

3. Recursion

   - Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It's commonly used in algorithms involving fractals, backtracking, and more.

4. Dynamic Programming

   - Dynamic programming is a method to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant calculations.

5. Greedy Algorithms

   - Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. They're used in problems like the knapsack problem and scheduling tasks.

6. Graph Algorithms
   - Graph algorithms are used to solve problems related to graphs, such as finding shortest paths, traversing graphs, and detecting cycles.
